# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts average rainfall using historical weather data from India (1901–2015) using simple machine learning models.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `main_notebook.ipynb`: Contains code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.
- `data/`: Contains the rainfall CSV file.
- `results/`: Graphs showing trends and predictions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

## 📈 ML Models
- Linear Regression (for rainfall amount)
- Random Forest Regressor (for better accuracy)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download ZIP
2. Install dependencies:

3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Colab
4. Upload your own CSV if using different rainfall data
